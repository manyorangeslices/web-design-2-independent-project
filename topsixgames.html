          <h2 class="gametitles">1 Red Dead Redemption 2 2018</h2>
          <p>This was the first open world game I really got my hands on, and I played it for a whole summer straight. I ate, breathed and slept Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2), skeptical at first, I was unsure of what the game was going to be like, as I had never played anything like it. I bought it on sale, excitedly opened it and read all the little bits of information I could from the disk case. The game comes with a map, if you buy its hard copy, and I soon learned that this game took place in a fictional area in America in 1899. This fictional hunk of land, of many landscapes, I fell in love with. There were moments in-game where I would be amazed by the visuals, by the connection the main character made with the land. I was stunned, that I had seen graphics evolve so much. The story was engaging, and it made you feel lots of things, like anger, and happiness, and relief. I would hate some characters so much, and love others entirely, and some of my feelings developed as the characters did. This game is truly a masterpiece, it’s everything you wish for in a game, and especially a story.</p>

          <h2 class="gametitles">2 Night in the Woods 2017</h2>
          <p>I have never related to a game as much as I relate to Night in the Woods. The story of a college dropout, reconnecting with friends, trying to understand feelings and emotions, getting back on track with your life, it’s something a lot of people can relate to. And this story does such a good job in taking it easy, showing the player a typical day in the life of the character when they get back home. There’s side quests, and relationships to re-build, but as the game slowly progresses, there’s something more. We aren’t just peeking into the life of a sad young adult, we’re living a horror-mystery. Suddenly we’re seeing this character go...insane. And solve a murder? It becomes incredibly non-relatable with the snap of a finger, but the story is still so good. The vibes that come off of this game is unlike anything I’ve played before, and the choices you make in this side scroller, indie game, are deep and true, and countless. You won’t play the same game twice, and that’s what will make me come back to it, again and again.</p>

          <h2 class="gametitles">3 Journey 2012</h2>
          <p>Journey is such an easy game to play, it takes virtually no time to play, and it never fails to amaze me. It’s easy in the sense that you just watch this gorgeous story unfold with minimal effort. You explore environments, but it’s fun to do, you put in some work, but it’s fun to see outcomes, and you see this character do what it needs to do, and you just…go with it. And playing online is so much more beautiful, playing a game with someone you have no clue who they are, you don’t know where they’re from. They could be from a whole different country, not speak your language, be anything, and you would never know. You can unanimously connect through helping each other complete tasks, try to communicate…but you can’t. You just go with the flow, and it’s beautiful. There’s so much to be said about this game, not just to play it, but to understand it on an emotional level. It’s really something to play.</p>

          <p>I love Animal Crossing New Horizons so much because I loved it as a kid, and reconnected with it through this game. Animal Crossing New Horizons gives nostalgic players everything they’ve ever wanted, and then some. There’s the basic mechanics we all love, like becoming friends with villagers, building up your clothing and item collection, and catching new bugs and fish. But because New Horizons can be updated at any time, new content is constantly being added. The new content will always make me want to play the game. There’s alway something new to discover, to see, to talk about. It’s just a cute game that isn’t stressful, or trying to push an agenda, you can do things at your own pace, and how you like it. Every players game is unique as nearly everything in-game is customizable, it really caters to the players which is really lovely and charming.</p>

          <p>I didn’t know what to expect going into Breath of the Wild, I hadn’t really followed it on social media, or heard of it much. But playing the actual game is super fun. You can do pretty much anything you want, collect anything you want, achieve whatever you want, and go at your own pace. The world is fun to explore, the characters are interesting to interact with, and the game helps flesh out a part of the Zelda universe we haven’t really seen. As a fan of the franchise from a young age, but never really played any game besides Link’s Awakening, it was fun to see what a Legend of Zelda game is like. That being said, the nostalgic connection, and the connection to the franchise is the only thing this game really has going for it, in my eyes. The characters are sub-par, the storyline is a little broken and seems a little rushed, the world is pretty tiny and the game goes by relatively quickly, with no emotional connection. But it’s fun the first few times you play it for sure.</p>

          <p>There's not much to be said about Moving Out, it's the best multi player game I have ever played. It makes me lose my voice, there's so much screaming and laughing involved. There's teamwork, and it's fun teamwork. It's stressful, but in a good way. It's just all good fun and lots of laughs. It's a genius game. The mechanics are incredible, easy to follow, the story is simple. Your task is straightforward, move all of the furniture or boxes into a moving van, but it's sometimes just so difficult to do just that, and it's hilarious. The colours and graphics are fun, and the characters are fun. The one true multi player game I will always come back to.</p>
